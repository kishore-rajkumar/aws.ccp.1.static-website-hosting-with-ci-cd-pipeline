<h1>Static Website Hosting with CI/CD Pipeline: </h1>

Demo: <a href="http://com.portfolio.personal.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/">Website Link</a>

<p><b>Description:</b> Build a simple static website (e.g., a personal portfolio, a landing page for a fictional business) and host it using Amazon S3 for storage and Amazon CloudFront for content delivery.

AWS Services Used: S3, CloudFront, Route 53 (for custom domain, optional), AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, IAM.</p>
<p><b>Why it's valuable:</b> Demonstrates understanding of scalable and cost-effective web hosting, version control, and automation in deploying updates.</p>
